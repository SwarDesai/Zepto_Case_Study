# Zepto Recommendation System Case Study 

## Overview:
This project is a hybrid recommendation system developed for Zepto, a quick commerce platform. It combines TF-IDF, BERT, and Item-based Collaborative Filtering to suggest complementary products based on user behavior. The system ensures contextually relevant recommendations, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## Features:
  * Hybrid Approach: Integrates TF-IDF, BERT embeddings, and Item-based Collaborative Filtering for precise recommendations.
  * Context-Aware Suggestions: Ensures recommendations are relevant to the products in a user's cart.
  * User Behavior Analysis: Leverages real-time shopping patterns for more personalized results.
  * Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale e-commerce data efficiently.

## Methodology:
TF-IDF Similarity:
  * Computes text-based similarity between product names and descriptions.
BERT Embeddings:
  * Captures deep semantic relationships between products for better recommendations.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:
  * Utilizes past purchase behavior to recommend frequently bought-together products.

## Dependencies:
  * Python 3.x
  * Transformers (Hugging Face)
  * Scikit-learn
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * NLTK

## Results:
  * Improved conversion rates by providing relevant product suggestions.
  * Better user engagement through contextually aware recommendations.
  * Optimized for large-scale real-time recommendations.

## Future Improvements:
  * Fine-tuning BERT with domain-specific data for improved contextual understanding.
  * Enhancing real-time recommendations using reinforcement learning.
  * Deploying the system as a microservice for seamless integration with Zepto's platform.
